His secret was consistency each cake tasted exactly like the first, and only he was allowed to make them to maintain this perfect standard. When Jamie, a new baker, suggested allowing others to help increase production, Mr. Shaheed explained, \"Our success comes from having one source the master baker-ensuring every cake is consistently perfect, just like the first.\" Inspired, Jamie applied this idea to their software system by implementing a design pattern for configuration settings. Just as Mr.Shaheed's approach kept the cakes consistent, the design pattern ensured the class maintained stable and controlled settings."
