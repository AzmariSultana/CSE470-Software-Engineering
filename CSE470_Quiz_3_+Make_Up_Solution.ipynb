        "Imagine you are making a local video streaming service like youtube. When you created the LocalVideoPlayer, it could not stream video as efficiently as Youtube does. Mainly because you have used localDataStream() in your system and Youtube is using universalDataStream(). Now you want to make an updated platform BetterLocalVideoPlayer that follows the youtube data streaming standards while implementing the previous methods. You also need to make sure people cannot copy your service just like you copied Youtube. Then you want users to be able to signup in the newly created player. Once they have completed the signup, they can subscribe to the channel. For simplicity you can assume there will only be one channel in this player. The driver code is given below for your reference."
